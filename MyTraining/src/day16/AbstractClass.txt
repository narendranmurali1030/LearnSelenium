Abstract Class
	abstract = high level about the class (unimplemented)
	
	
	Applicable for Class, method 
	
	Abstract Method will not have implementation
	Abstract Method should be appended with Abstract Keyword
	If your class has any abstract method then your class also becomes abstract
	
	for any abstract class we cannot create or instantiate an object
	if in the subtype we are not sure about the implementation then make the sub type also as abstract
	
	it is not always mandatory to have the unimplemented method to make the class as abstract
	(without any unimplemented method , your class can be abstract)
	
	
	Can abstract class have
		constructor = are allowed
		static method and static variable = are allowed
