How to handle exception (Blocks)
	Try = code try / execute
	Catch = exceptions are catched here
	Finally = finally this gets executed at last / finally
	
Note: All exceptions are java classes


Can we write multiple catch blocks ?

What is throws ? when a method throws a exception we need to catch.. surround with try catch or rethrow it
returns in try catch block ? how it works ? (Note return is the last line of code)
	returns will end the execution of that method and rest of the lines of code would not get executed except finally block
can we throw multiple exceptions to a method ? Yes we can have multiple exception in the method as throws
Can we rethrow another exception within catch block ? Yes its allowed
