Collections

	array => Class, non growable or length is fixed, Single / Multi Dimension
	Collections => Interface , growable or not of fixed length, Single Dimension only
	
	List (I) eg) studentNames 
		implementation class ArrayList (C)
		coming from java.util
		it will allow duplicates
		size is dynamically growable
		FIFO, insertion order will be maintained by default
		index starts from 0
		
	Set (I) eg) studentRollNumber		
		implementation class HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet (C)
		coming from java.util
		it will NOT allow duplicates
		size is dynamically growable
		order will be maintained based on the implementation class
		index starts from 0
		
		Note: Everything is same as List except get method which is not applicable here
		
		LinkedHashSet = follows the insertion order
		TreeSet = follow ascii order
		HashSet = follows hashing algorithm (unknown or randomised)
		
		Why get method is not there ?
			get method will not be there bcos order is not maintained in set, (order is based on the implementation class)
			Due to which we cannot use for loop here (.get wont be here)
			Hence We can use for each
