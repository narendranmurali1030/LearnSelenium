How to inspect an element ?



Locators (Otherwise called as Selectors)
	ID : Most Preferred, but when you see some numbers then do not use it
	Name : you can use it, but when you see some numbers then do not use it	
	LinkText : will have "a" tag which denotes its a link, you can use the text of it.  (remove trailing spaces)
	ClassName : you can use it, but when you see whitespaces do not use it
	Partial Link Text : similar to linktext but giving the partial locator value
	TagName : not advised but still can be used as long as the page has only one specific tag or first matching tag
	Xpath
	Css
	
	
	Note: 
		locators are attributes, and its in orange color
		text will be in black color
		values will be in blue color
		tags will be in purple color
		Multi Matches means it picks up the first match from the DOM
		No Match means NoSuchElementException (use Leafground)
		timeout (dmti)
			implicit wait will wait for the given duration when the element is not found
			is defined once and applicable for all driver.findelement and findelements

Xpath
	XML Path
		types
			relative  
				Syntax = //tagName eg) //div 
				this will directly get into the tag
			absolute 
				Syntax = /tagName eg) /html/body/div[2]/div[2]/div/form/p[1]/input 
				this will follow from the root
